# Geometric Memory: Minimal Defensive Publication

**Author**: Hyxos Inc.

**Purpose**: Establish prior art

## Abstract

Geometric Memory (GM) uses geometric positions and relationships to organize and retrieve data, where memory locations are addressed through geometric coordinates rather than sequential integers.

## Core Concept

A Geometric Memory system consists of:
- **Positions**: Locations defined by geometric coordinates
- **Relationships**: Spatial connections between positions
- **Patterns**: Geometric structures for data organization

## Basic Operations

**Storage**: Data mapped to geometric positions
**Retrieval**: Access via geometric coordinates
**Navigation**: Movement through geometric space

## Memory Organization

Geometric Memory can utilize:
- Circular arrangements
- Polygonal structures
- Multi-dimensional spaces
- Distance-based relationships

## Applications

Geometric Memory can be applied to:
- Spatial data structures
- Pattern-based retrieval systems
- Associative memory architectures
- Navigation and pathfinding

## Prior Art Declaration

This publication establishes that as of August 20, 2025, the concept of using geometric positions and relationships for memory organization in computational systems is disclosed and cannot be exclusively patented by others.

The basic concept of geometric memory addressing is hereby placed in the public domain to prevent others from claiming exclusive rights while specific implementations remain proprietary.
