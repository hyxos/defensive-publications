# Defensive Publications

This repository contains defensive publications to establish prior art and prevent others from patenting foundational concepts while maintaining trade secret protection for implementations.

## Purpose

These publications serve to:
1. Establish prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)(1)(A)
2. Prevent others from obtaining exclusive patent rights on disclosed concepts
3. Maintain trade secret protection for specific implementations
4. Create timestamped evidence of invention dates

## Legal Effect

Once this repository is made public:
- The disclosed concepts cannot be patented by others
- GitHub's commit timestamps serve as legal evidence of disclosure dates
- The specific implementations and methods remain protected as trade secrets
- Copyright in the expressions remains with Hyxos Inc.
