**Purpose**: Establish prior art

## Abstract

Rational Addressing (RA) uses rational numbers n/d to represent positions, where n and d are integers and the value represents a fractional position between 0 and 1.

## Core Concept

A Rational Address consists of:
- Numerator (n): integer
- Denominator (d): positive integer  
- Value: n/d representing a position in [0, 1)

## Basic Operations

Addition: (a/b) + (c/d) = (ad + bc)/(bd)  
Modular reduction: Results reduced modulo 1 to stay in [0, 1)

## Applications

Rational Addressing can be applied to:
- Circular data structures
- Modular arithmetic systems
- Fractional indexing schemes

## Prior Art Declaration

This publication establishes that as of August 20, 2025, the concept of using rational numbers for addressing in computational systems is disclosed and cannot be exclusively patented by others.

The basic mathematical concept of rational number addressing is hereby placed in the public domain to prevent others from claiming exclusive rights while specific implementations remain proprietary.
